## The Story

We are a software development studio centered around its experts who are
dedicated to seek perfection in their work. We work slow but sure. And we see
"what" as value for our customers and "how" as value for the studio.

Inspired from this vision, we named our studio as __Mouseless__.

To state the obvious, by mouse we mean the pointing device that enables a human
to control a pointer on the computer screen, not the animal. Our intention is
to make everyone in the team use their mouse less, and preferably become a
mouseless developer.

## Usage In Plain Text

Mouseless name should be used as `mouseless` wherever suitable unless you use
it in a formal context or a documentation, like in this very document. Social
media profile names should be lowercase.
